# Pacmen Game
## Factory for making pacmen

You can create as many pacmen as you want and start the game where the pacmen will move across the screen and bounce off the walls. When button "Add PacMan" is pressed a new pac man image is created and added to the "game" div. It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.
Each pacman bounces off any wall it hits. 

How to Run:  Click on the button "Add PacMan". It will create a new Pac man. Click on "Start Game" button and the pac man will start moving across the screen. The speed of the Pacmen will increase if you click on "Start Game" button again.

Roadmap of future improvements: I can make Pacmen of different colors and change their size when they hit the wall.
